      <description>Developed and deployed a Streamlit application for mapping and predicting the resilience of Victoria&amp;rsquo;s (Canada) water network. Generally visualized the impact of extreme events (heavy rainfall, floods, earthquake) on the resilience of water networks. The application also displayed key metrics that showed such impact and the requirement to improve the resilience of the network.</description>

      <description>Developed with data collected from IMDB, a movie recommender system that predicts users&amp;rsquo; movie preferences with high accuracy. This system ensured that users were connected with movies that aligned with their interests and passion giving them a personalized and enjoyable movie watching experience.
This was achieved by creating an SVD++ model which among other querks, extends the traditional collaborative filtering approach by incorporating implicit feedback from user-item interactions which captures user preferences more effectively.</description>

      <description>Built and deployed on an EC2 instance, a Streamlit app for sentiment classification of climate-related tweets using Python and machine learning.
The motivation behind the project was to harness the power of data science to gain insights into public opinions on climate change through the analysis of Twitter data. In an era where climate change is a critical global issue, understanding public sentiment can be pivotal for informed decision-making and advocacy efforts.</description>
